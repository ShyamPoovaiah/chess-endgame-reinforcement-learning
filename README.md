# chess-endgame-reinforcement-learning
An attempt to solve endgames using reinforcement learning

We are attempting to tackle the following problems:
1. Setting up UCI (An interface to allow chess engines to talk to user interfaces).
2. Writing rules of the game.
3. Getting the environment ready to train models. (Google collab has some free usage.)
